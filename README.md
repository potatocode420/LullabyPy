# LullabyPy
Discord music bot named Lullaby

## Future features
1. -save Save playlist
2. -playlist moving -playlist unmoving Different playlist types of moving and unmoving

## Current problems
1. Theoretically, playlist.py and player.py are supposed to work together. In hindsight, playlist.py is currently redundant. I will need to assign proper roles to these 2 files and refactor the code accordingly. (Most likely, player.py to deal with discord functions, and playlist.py for logic)

2. Currently, I am using youtube-dl to search songs online but it takes awhile for Lullaby to search up a song to stream. I am unsure of whether youtube-dl is the problem or the way I have coded it makes it slow.
